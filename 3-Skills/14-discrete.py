# Module 14: Discrete Math Basics
######
# Concepts:

# Sets and set operations


# - Create two sets A and B, add/remove elements, and check membership using `in`.

# - Perform union (A | B), intersection (A & B), and difference (A - B).

# - Use set comprehension to generate a set from a list of numbers.


# Logic and truth tables


# - Use Python `and`, `or`, `not` to construct logical expressions.

# - Build a truth table for two propositions using all combinations of True/False.

# - Evaluate compound propositions like (p and q) or not r and show the results.


# Functions and relations


# - Define a function that maps each element of A = {1, 2, 3} to B = {a, b, c}.

# - Represent a relation as a list of tuples and test if it's reflexive, symmetric, or transitive.

# - Write a function to determine if a mapping is one-to-one or onto.


# Graph theory basics


# - Represent an undirected graph using an adjacency list (dictionary of lists).

# - Write a function to compute the degree of a vertex and find isolated nodes.

# - Check for simple cycles or if the graph is Eulerian (all vertices even degree).


# Combinatorics and counting


# - Use the multiplication principle to count total outcomes of an event.

# - Calculate permutations and combinations using `math.perm()` and `math.comb()`.

# - Use the binomial theorem to expand (a + b)^n and compute binomial coefficients.



######
# Exercises:

# 1. Create two sets A and B, then print their union and intersection.

# 2. Check if the number 3 is in set A.

# 3. Write the truth table for p → q.

# 4. Evaluate the expression (p or not q) for p = True, q = False.

# 5. Define a function f(x) = x² and print f(1) to f(5).

# 6. Represent a simple undirected graph using a dictionary.

# 7. Find the degree of each node in the graph.

# 8. Count how many 3-digit numbers can be made using digits 1–5 without repetition.

# 9. Compute the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 objects.

# 10. Determine if a given graph has a cycle.
