# Module 16: Scientific and Mathematical Programming
###
# Concepts:

# Scientific computation using numpy


# - Create a numpy array of 1000 evenly spaced values between 0 and 2π.

# - Compute sin(x), cos(x), and exp(x) for an array of inputs.

# - Perform vectorized operations like element-wise multiplication on arrays.


# Plotting with matplotlib


# - Plot y = sin(x) and y = cos(x) on the same axes with labels and legends.

# - Create a scatter plot of random points with different colors.

# - Use subplots to visualize different functions in separate panels.


# Solving equations numerically


# - Solve ax² + bx + c = 0 using the quadratic formula and numpy.sqrt.

# - Use scipy.optimize.fsolve to solve nonlinear equations like cos(x) = x.

# - Find the x-value where two curves intersect by subtracting and solving.


# Simulating real-world phenomena


# - Simulate projectile motion under gravity (no air resistance) and plot the trajectory.

# - Model exponential population growth using y = y0 * e^(rt).

# - Simulate the decay of a radioactive element over time.


# Constants and units


# - Use scipy.constants to access values like g, c, h, and pi.

# - Convert between units like meters to feet or Celsius to Kelvin.

# - Use constants in physics equations such as kinetic energy or potential energy.


# Integrals, derivatives, and systems of equations


# - Use numpy.gradient to approximate the derivative of a function.

# - Compute the integral of x² from 0 to 5 using trapezoidal rule (numpy.trapz).

# - Solve a system like 2x + 3y = 5 and 4x - y = 1 using numpy.linalg.solve.
