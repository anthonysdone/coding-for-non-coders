# Module 13: Algorithms in Python
###
# Concepts:

# Linear search


# - Write a function that searches for a value in a list and returns its index.

# - Modify the function to return all matching indices.

# - Count how many comparisons are made in a worst-case search.


# Binary search


# - Implement binary search on a sorted list and return the index of a target.

# - Add a counter to track the number of steps taken.

# - Test the algorithm on various input sizes to see how time scales.


# Bubble sort


# - Write a function that performs bubble sort on a list.

# - Track the number of swaps made during sorting.

# - Add an optimization to stop early if the list is already sorted.


# Merge sort


# - Implement merge sort recursively and print each merge step.

# - Analyze the time complexity for different input lengths.

# - Compare the number of operations with bubble sort on the same list.


# Time complexity (Big-O)


# - Identify the Big-O for linear search, binary search, and merge sort.

# - Discuss how the algorithm's performance changes with larger inputs.

# - Use Python's `time` module to benchmark different algorithms.


# Recursion vs iteration


# - Write both a recursive and iterative version of factorial.

# - Compare recursive and iterative list reversal.

# - Discuss stack overflow risks in deep recursion.


# Greedy algorithm basics


# - Write a function that returns change using the fewest coins.

# - Use a greedy algorithm to select items with max value per weight.

# - Identify when a greedy solution gives an incorrect result.
