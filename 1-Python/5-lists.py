######
# Concepts:

# List creation and indexing


# - Create a list of five fruit names and print the list.

# - Print the second item from a list.

# - Change the first element in a list to a new value.


# List slicing


# - Slice a list to get the first three elements.

# - Slice a list to get the last two elements.

# - Reverse a list using slicing.


# Basic operations: append, insert, pop, remove


# - Add an item to a list using append().

# - Insert an item at index 2.

# - Remove the last item using pop().


# Iteration with lists


# - Use a for loop to print all items in a list.

# - Count how many items in a list are greater than 10.

# - Create a new list with squares of numbers using a loop.


# Membership and length


# - Check if "apple" is in a list.

# - Count and print the number of items in a list.

# - Use `not in` to check if an item is absent.
