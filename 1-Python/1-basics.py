# Module 1: Python Basics
######
# Concepts:

# Variables and data types (int, float, str, bool)


# - Create variables for a book: title, pages, rating, finished.

# - What are the types of: 3.14, "True", False, 42, '42'?

# - Swap two integers without a third variable.


# Input/output: print(), input()


# - Ask user for name, greet them.

# - Input fruit and quantity, print "You bought 4 apples."

# - Ask name, age, color; print each clearly.


# Arithmetic and assignment


# - Perform +=, -=, *=, /= on x = 10.

# - Input radius, compute circumference.

# - Take two numbers, print average.


# Comments


# - Add comments to a square-calculating script.

# - Comment a greeting program.

# - Label each section in a program with comments.


# Type conversion
# - Convert string input to int, add to number.

# - Use float() to compute BMI from inputs.

# - Show type before/after conversion.


######
# Exercises:

# 1. Store your name, age, and height in variables. Print them.

# 2. Take two numbers as input and print their sum.

# 3. Write a script to convert inches to centimeters.

# 4. Concatenate two strings and print them.

# 5. Ask for the user's name and greet them.

# 6. Calculate the area of a circle given radius.

# 7. Convert a string to an integer and perform addition.

# 8. Print the type of several variables (int, float, str).

# 9. Take age input, add 1, and print the age next year.

# 10. Write comments describing each line of your code.
