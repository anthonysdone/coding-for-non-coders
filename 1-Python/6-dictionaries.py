# Module 6: Dictionaries
######
# Concepts:

# Creating dictionaries


# - Create a dictionary with three key-value pairs.

# - Make an empty dictionary and add items later.

# - Use different data types for keys and values.


# Adding and updating key-value pairs


# - Add a new key "color" with a value to an existing dictionary.

# - Change the value of an existing key.

# - Add multiple new key-value pairs in one step.


# Accessing values by key


# - Print the value of the "name" key.

# - Use a variable to store a key, then access its value.

# - Try accessing a key that doesn't exist (see what happens).


# Iterating through keys, values, and items


# - Print all keys using a for loop.

# - Print all values using a for loop.

# - Print both keys and values using .items().


# Using in to check for keys


# - Check if "age" exists in a dictionary.

# - Print a message only if "email" is a key.

# - Use `not in` to check if a key is missing.


# Using .get() and .pop()


# - Use .get() to access a possibly missing key.

# - Use .pop() to remove a key and print the removed value.

# - Safely get a key with a default if not found.


######
# Exercises:

# 1. Create a dictionary with keys "name", "age", and "city", and print it.

# 2. Access and print the value associated with the "name" key.

# 3. Add a new key "email" with a value to the dictionary.

# 4. Update the "age" value in the dictionary to a new number.

# 5. Use a for loop to print all the keys in the dictionary.

# 6. Use a for loop to print all the values in the dictionary.

# 7. Use in to check if the key "phone" exists.

# 8. Use .get() to retrieve the value for "city" safely.

# 9. Remove the "email" key using .pop() and print the updated dictionary.

# 10. Create a dictionary where keys are student names and values are their grades, then print all names with grades over 90.
