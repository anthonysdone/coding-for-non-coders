# Module 7: Objects in Python
###
# Concepts:

# Classes and objects


# - Define a class `Person` with attributes like name and age, and create multiple instances.

# - Use the `__init__` constructor to assign values when an object is created.

# - Access and update attributes through instances of the class.


# Methods and the self parameter


# - Write instance methods that use `self` to access and modify object data.

# - Add a method greet() that uses the object's name to print a message.

# - Demonstrate that each object maintains its own state using self.


# Instance and class variables


# - Declare and differentiate instance variables (self.attribute) and class variables.

# - Add a class variable to count how many instances of a class have been created.

# - Show how modifying a class variable affects all instances, while instance variables remain separate.



###
# Exercises:

# 1. Create a Person class with name and age attributes.

# 2. Add a greet() method that prints a personalized greeting.

# 3. Instantiate three Person objects and call their methods.

# 4. Add a class variable to count how many Person objects are created.

# 5. Create a method that updates a Person's age.

# 6. Create a Book class with title and author attributes and a method to display them.

# 7. Write a method in Book that returns the author's name in uppercase.

# 8. Make a Student class that stores a list of grades and calculates the average.

# 9. Demonstrate the use of both instance and class variables in Student.

# 10. Add a method to Student that adds a grade to the list and updates the average.
